离散微分几何 - 1 - Introduction

## Introduction

Application: 

- Geometry Processing: Up-sample / Down-sample — 3d-surface
- Shape Analysis
- Machine Learning.
- Numerical Simu

## What will we learn / Won't

1. Diff Geometry
2. Geo Processing
3. Central — Link These two perspectives

Won't

1. view points on diff geometry
2. huge number of algorithms

## What is Diff Geo

### Diff Geo

1. Talk about local properties of shape
2. and thier connection to global properties of shape
3. Lang of geometry physics

### Discrete Diff Geo

1. infinity no longer allowed
2. expressed in terms of lenghs, angles
3. Loss is littow: captures many fundamental ideas

> Translate continuous to discrete

### How to

DDG — obtain discrete definitions

1. write down several equivalent definitions in the smooth setting
2. apply each smooth definition to an object in discrete
3. Determine which properties are captured by each resulting inequivalent discrete definition

## Example: Discrete Curvature

### Curves in the Plane

in 2D, a **parameterized curve** is a map taking each point in an interval $[0, L]$.

Discrete Curves in the Plane:

- piecewise linear parameterized curve, vertices connected by straight line segments

- view as a interval $\rightarrow$ Segments

### Tangent/Normal/Curvature

unit tangent:
$$
T(s) := \frac{d}{ds} \gamma(s) / |\frac{d}{ds}\gamma(s)|
$$
unit Normal:
$$
N(s) = \mathcal JT(s)
$$

- $\mathcal J$表示顺时针旋转

curvature can be expressed as the rate of change in the tangent.
$$
\kappa(s):=\langle N, \frac{d}{ds} T\rangle
$$

- Key idea 1 — curvature is a second devirative.
- Key idea 2 — curvature can have sign.

### To Discrete

in continuous:

1. Turning angle 
2. length variation
3. steiner formula
4. osculating curve

### Integrated Curvature

$$
\int _ b ^ a \kappa(s) \mathrm ds = \varphi(b) - \varphi(a)
$$

consider $\gamma_{i - 1}$, $\gamma_{i}$,$\gamma_{i + 1}$
$$
\theta _ i =: \kappa_i ^A\quad (\text{turning angle})
$$

- integrated rather than pointwise values
- total change in angle, not derivative.

### Length Variation

> The fastest way to descrease the length of a curve is to move it in the normal direction, with speed proportioonal to curvature

Intuition — in flat rigions, normal motions doesn't change curve length.
